# Nevi

A fast, Neovim-inspired terminal editor written in Rust.

*Your vim muscle memory, without the configuration overhead.*

![Nevi demo — fuzzy file finder with preview, vim motions, Harpoon quick-switch, live grep, and live theme switching](nevi-demo.gif)

> **Tip:** To see every keybinding available in Nevi, run `:Keymaps` (or press `<Space>fk`) — a searchable list with a description for each one.

## Why Nevi?

**The Problem:**
I love Neovim and Zed. Zed is an amazing editor - fast, modern, and beautiful. But it doesn't have all the vim keybinds I use daily, which stopped me from fully migrating to it. Neovim is powerful but can become slow with plugins. Helix uses Kakoune-style keybindings which require relearning muscle memory.

**Nevi's Goal:**
A fast, native terminal editor where your existing vim/neovim muscle memory just works. No relearning keybindings, no plugin configuration overhead, no compromise on modern features like LSP and tree-sitter.

| Editor | Vim Keybinds | Built-in Features | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|-------|
| Neovim | Full | Via plugins | Powerful but plugin-dependent |
| Zed | Partial | Yes | Fast but vim mode incomplete |
| Helix | Kakoune-style | Yes | Different keybind philosophy |
| **Nevi** | In Progress | Yes | Aiming for full vim compatibility |

> **Note:** Nevi is under active development. Most common vim keybindings are implemented, with more being added regularly. See [Keybindings](#keybindings) for current status.

## Installation

### Homebrew

```bash
brew install anthonyamaro15/nevi/nevi
```

Or tap first:

```bash
brew tap anthonyamaro15/nevi
brew install nevi
```

### Requirements

Nevi is currently macOS-only.

Required for Homebrew install:

- Homebrew. Build dependencies such as Rust are installed by the formula when
  needed.

Required to build from source:

- Rust toolchain with `cargo`
- Git, if cloning the repository with `git clone`
- Xcode Command Line Tools if your Rust setup prompts for native build tools

Required at runtime after any install method:

- A terminal emulator

Verify an installed binary with:

```bash
nevi --version
```

Not required:

- `ripgrep`, `grep`, `fd`, `fzf`, or the `tree-sitter` CLI. Nevi's file finder,
  live grep, fuzzy matching, and syntax highlighting are built into the binary.

Optional tools unlock optional features:

| Feature | Optional tool | Install hint |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| `:LazyGit` / `<Space>gg` | `lazygit` | `brew install lazygit` |
| Rust LSP | `rust-analyzer` | `rustup component add rust-analyzer` |
| TypeScript / JavaScript LSP | `typescript-language-server` and `typescript` | `npm install -g typescript typescript-language-server` |
| CSS / JSON / HTML LSP | `vscode-langservers-extracted` | `npm install -g vscode-langservers-extracted` |
| TOML LSP | `taplo` | `cargo install taplo-cli --locked` |
| Python LSP | `pyright` | `npm install -g pyright` |
| Markdown LSP | `marksman` | Optional and disabled by default |
| External formatters | Whatever formatter you configure | Examples: `biome`, `prettier`, `black`, `gofmt` |
| Git signs / `:GitChanges` | A Git repository | No external `git` CLI required |
| GitHub Copilot completions | GitHub account and network access | No local Copilot binary required |

If an optional tool is missing, the rest of Nevi still works. Run
`:checkhealth` or `:Health` inside Nevi to inspect config paths, keymap
overrides, LSP settings, profiling status, and common setup issues.

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anthonyamaro15/nevi.git
cd nevi
cargo build --release
./target/release/nevi
```

### Add to PATH (optional)

```bash
cp target/release/nevi ~/.local/bin/
# or
sudo cp target/release/nevi /usr/local/bin/
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Open current directory
nevi .

# Open a file
nevi src/main.rs

# Open multiple files
nevi file1.rs file2.rs
```

**Basic commands:**
- `:w` - Save
- `:q` - Quit
- `:wq` - Save and quit
- `:checkhealth` / `:Health` - Open editor health report in a read-only `[health]` buffer
- `:ConfigOpen` / `:config` - Open your user config file
- `:ConfigDefaults` - View the latest built-in default config template
- `:MarkdownPreview` - Open rendered Markdown reader for `.md` files (`j/k`, `Ctrl-d/u`, `g/G`, `q`)
- `<Space>ff` - Find files
- `<Space>fg` - Live grep
- `<Space>gc` - Git changes picker
- `<Space>e` - File explorer
- `<Space>tt` - Terminal picker
- `<Space>tn` / `<Space>tj` / `<Space>tk` - New / next / previous terminal session
- `<Space>tr` - Rename active terminal session
- `<Space>fk` - Search keymaps (keybinding cheatsheet)

## Configuration

Config location: `~/.config/nevi/config.toml`

A template config file is created automatically on first run. Here's an example:

```toml
[editor]
tab_width = 2
format_on_save = true
relative_numbers = true
scroll_off = 8

[theme]
colorscheme = "onedark"

[terminal]
popup_width_ratio = 0.9
popup_height_ratio = 0.9

[lsp]
enabled = true

[copilot]
enabled = true
```

Run `:ConfigOpen` (or `:config`) to open your user config file from inside
Nevi. Run `:ConfigDefaults` to view the latest built-in default config template
without changing your existing config. Existing config files stay user-owned;
Nevi does not rewrite them when new defaults are added.

See the generated config file at `~/.config/nevi/config.toml` for all available
options with documentation.

## Custom Themes

Nevi comes with 15+ built-in themes. You can also create your own custom themes.

### Built-in Themes

Select a theme with `:theme <name>` or `<Space>ft` to open the theme picker.

Available themes: `onedark`, `dracula`, `gruvbox`, `nord`, `tokyonight`, `catppuccin-mocha`, `rose-pine`, `solarized-dark`, `kanagawa`, `monokai`, `everforest`, `github-dark`, `ayu-dark`, `palenight`, `nightfox`

### Creating Custom Themes

1. **Location:** Place `.toml` files in `~/.config/nevi/themes/`
2. **Template:** A commented template is auto-generated at `~/.config/nevi/themes/_template.toml`
3. **Naming:** The filename becomes the theme name (e.g., `mytheme.toml` → `:theme mytheme`)

Copy the template to get started:

```bash
cp ~/.config/nevi/themes/_template.toml ~/.config/nevi/themes/mytheme.toml
```

### Theme Structure

```toml
# Define reusable colors
[palette]
red = "#e06c75"
blue = "#61afef"
bg = "#282c34"

# Syntax highlighting (can reference palette or use hex)
[syntax]
keyword = { fg = "purple" }
string = { fg = "green" }
comment = { fg = "gray", italic = true }

# UI elements
[ui]
background = "bg"
foreground = "#abb2bf"
cursor_line = "#2c313c"

[ui.statusline]
mode_normal = "blue"
mode_insert = "green"

# And more: [ui.completion], [ui.finder], [diagnostic], [git]
```

See `~/.config/nevi/themes/_template.toml` for the complete reference with all available options.

## Keybindings

Nevi aims for full vim/neovim keybind compatibility. Most common keybindings are already implemented.

> **Full reference:** See [KEYBINDINGS.md](KEYBINDINGS.md) for the complete keybind documentation with examples and tips.

### Movement

> **Missing a keybind?** Check [KEYBINDINGS.md](KEYBINDINGS.md) for the full list of what's implemented. If you don't see the one you want, take a look at the [keybind roadmap](KEYBINDS_ROADMAP.md) to see if it's already planned — and if it's not, [open an issue](https://github.com/anthonyamaro15/nevi/issues) to request it (PRs welcome too).

## Language Support

### LSP Servers

| Language | Server | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Rust | rust-analyzer | Supported |
| TypeScript/JavaScript | typescript-language-server | Supported |
| Python | pyright | Supported |
| CSS/SCSS | vscode-css-language-server | Supported |
| JSON | vscode-json-language-server | Supported |
| TOML | taplo | Supported |
| HTML | vscode-html-language-server | Supported |
| Markdown | marksman | Optional, disabled by default |

LSP servers are auto-detected when installed. See [`~/.config/nevi/config.toml`](#configuration) for LSP configuration options.

If a server is missing, Nevi shows an install hint in the LSP status/error
message. You can also run `:checkhealth` to review the active LSP configuration.

> **Missing a language?** Open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/anthonyamaro15/nevi/issues) and we'll work on adding support!

### External Formatters

Configure formatters in `~/.config/nevi/languages.toml`:

```toml
[typescript]
formatter = { command = "biome", args = ["format", "--stdin-file-path", "{file}"] }
```

Formatters are external commands. Nevi only runs a formatter if you configure
one; otherwise it falls back to LSP formatting when available.

### Performance Profiling

Profiling is opt-in and disabled by default. To capture hot-path timings while
using Nevi locally:

```bash
NEVI_PROFILE=1 cargo run --release -- path/to/file
```

Nevi writes raw timing events and a summary to `/tmp/nevi_profile.log`. The
summary includes count, retained sample count, total, average, p50, p95, and max
microseconds for metrics such as key handling, syntax updates, full renders, and
terminal-only renders.

Run `:checkhealth` (or `:Health`) inside Nevi to open a read-only `[health]`
buffer with config paths, config discoverability commands, keymap overrides and
warnings, LSP settings, profiling status, and any profile summary from
`/tmp/nevi_profile.log`. Because it is a regular buffer, normal motions, search,
and yank commands work there. Profile summaries are written when a profiled Nevi
session exits.
