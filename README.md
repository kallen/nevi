# Nevi

A fast, Neovim-inspired terminal editor written in Rust.

*Your vim muscle memory, without the configuration overhead.*

## Why Nevi?

**The Problem:**
I love Neovim and Zed. Zed is an amazing editor - fast, modern, and beautiful. But it doesn't have all the vim keybinds I use daily, which stopped me from fully migrating to it. Neovim is powerful but can become slow with plugins. Helix uses Kakoune-style keybindings which require relearning muscle memory.

**Nevi's Goal:**
A fast, native terminal editor where your existing vim/neovim muscle memory just works. No relearning keybindings, no plugin configuration overhead, no compromise on modern features like LSP and tree-sitter.

| Editor | Vim Keybinds | Built-in Features | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|-------|
| Neovim | Full | Via plugins | Powerful but plugin-dependent |
| Zed | Partial | Yes | Fast but vim mode incomplete |
| Helix | Kakoune-style | Yes | Different keybind philosophy |
| **Nevi** | In Progress | Yes | Aiming for full vim compatibility |

> **Note:** Nevi is under active development. Most common vim keybindings are implemented, with more being added regularly. See [Keybindings](#keybindings) for current status.

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anthonyamaro15/nevi.git
cd nevi
cargo build --release
./target/release/nevi
```

### Add to PATH (optional)

```bash
cp target/release/nevi ~/.local/bin/
# or
sudo cp target/release/nevi /usr/local/bin/
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Open current directory
nevi .

# Open a file
nevi src/main.rs

# Open multiple files
nevi file1.rs file2.rs
```

**Basic commands:**
- `:w` - Save
- `:q` - Quit
- `:wq` - Save and quit
- `:MarkdownPreview` - Open rendered Markdown reader for `.md` files (`j/k`, `Ctrl-d/u`, `g/G`, `q`)
- `<Space>ff` - Find files
- `<Space>fg` - Live grep
- `<Space>gc` - Git changes picker
- `<Space>e` - File explorer
- `<Space>tt` - Terminal picker

## Configuration

Config location: `~/.config/nevi/config.toml`

A template config file is created automatically on first run. Here's an example:

```toml
[editor]
tab_width = 2
format_on_save = true
relative_numbers = true
scroll_off = 8

[theme]
colorscheme = "onedark"

[terminal]
popup_width_ratio = 0.9
popup_height_ratio = 0.9

[lsp]
enabled = true

[copilot]
enabled = true
```

See the generated config file at `~/.config/nevi/config.toml` for all available options with documentation.

## Custom Themes

Nevi comes with 15+ built-in themes. You can also create your own custom themes.

### Built-in Themes

Select a theme with `:theme <name>` or `<Space>ft` to open the theme picker.

Available themes: `onedark`, `dracula`, `gruvbox`, `nord`, `tokyonight`, `catppuccin-mocha`, `rose-pine`, `solarized-dark`, `kanagawa`, `monokai`, `everforest`, `github-dark`, `ayu-dark`, `palenight`, `nightfox`

### Creating Custom Themes

1. **Location:** Place `.toml` files in `~/.config/nevi/themes/`
2. **Template:** A commented template is auto-generated at `~/.config/nevi/themes/_template.toml`
3. **Naming:** The filename becomes the theme name (e.g., `mytheme.toml` → `:theme mytheme`)

Copy the template to get started:

```bash
cp ~/.config/nevi/themes/_template.toml ~/.config/nevi/themes/mytheme.toml
```

### Theme Structure

```toml
# Define reusable colors
[palette]
red = "#e06c75"
blue = "#61afef"
bg = "#282c34"

# Syntax highlighting (can reference palette or use hex)
[syntax]
keyword = { fg = "purple" }
string = { fg = "green" }
comment = { fg = "gray", italic = true }

# UI elements
[ui]
background = "bg"
foreground = "#abb2bf"
cursor_line = "#2c313c"

[ui.statusline]
mode_normal = "blue"
mode_insert = "green"

# And more: [ui.completion], [ui.finder], [diagnostic], [git]
```

See `~/.config/nevi/themes/_template.toml` for the complete reference with all available options.

## Keybindings

Nevi aims for full vim/neovim keybind compatibility. Most common keybindings are already implemented.
