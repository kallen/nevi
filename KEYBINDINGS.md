# Nevi Keybindings

Complete reference for all keybindings in Nevi. If you're familiar with Vim/Neovim, most of these will feel natural.

## Customization

All available keybindings in this doc work out of the box, but you can customize them in `~/.config/nevi/config.toml`.

### Changing the Leader Key

The leader key is `Space` by default. To change it:

```toml
[keymap]
leader = ","  # Use comma as leader instead
```

To disable the leader popup while keeping leader mappings active:

```toml
[keymap]
show_leader_popup = false
```

### Configuring Explorer Width

The file explorer sidebar is `35` columns wide by default. To change that:

```toml
[explorer]
width = 42
```

### Remapping Keys in Normal Mode

Want `H` to go to the start of the line and `L` to go to the end? Add this:

```toml
[[keymap.normal]]
from = "H"
to = "^"

[[keymap.normal]]
from = "L"
to = "$"
```

Now pressing `H` does what `^` normally does (jump to first non-blank character).

### Remapping Keys in Visual Mode

Visual mode keys can be remapped with the same key notation:

```toml
[[keymap.visual]]
from = "s"
to = "S"
```

Now pressing `s` in visual mode surrounds the selection instead of changing it.

### Adding Leader Shortcuts

Create your own `<leader>` + key combinations:

```toml
[[keymap.leader_mappings]]
key = "s"
action = ":wa"
desc = "Save all files"
```

Now `<Space>s` saves all open files.

For example, the terminal picker is mapped to `<Space>tt` by default and can be changed the same way:

```toml
[[keymap.leader_mappings]]
key = "tt"
action = ":Terminals"
desc = "Terminal picker"
```

### Key Notation

When specifying keys, use these formats:
- Regular keys: `"a"`, `"H"`, `";"`, `"0"`
- Control: `"<C-s>"` (Ctrl+s)
- Combined modifiers: `"<C-S-t>"` (Ctrl+Shift+t), `"<C-Tab>"`
- Special keys: `"<CR>"` (Enter), `"<Esc>"`, `"<Tab>"`, `"<Space>"`, `"<BS>"` (Backspace)

> **Tip:** The config file at `~/.config/nevi/config.toml` is auto-generated on first run and contains a full reference with all options commented out.
